// Background tasks (docs/decisions.md D5.7): a piece of work a bot hands to a separate, short-lived
// harness session of its own so it stays free to chat. The bot starts it with `start_task`; when it
// ends, its result comes back to the bot in the conversation it was started from and the bot reports
// it there in its own words. The owner sees running work as a status line ("Handling…") and in the
// details pane's Tasks tab; its steps never appear as chat bubbles.
